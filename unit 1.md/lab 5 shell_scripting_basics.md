Shell scripting helps us **automate tasks** in Linux by writing commands in a file and letting the shell run them one by one.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Shell Script?

* A **shell** = command-line program (like `bash`, `zsh`, `sh`).
* A **script** = text file with commands.
* Usually ends with `.sh` but not compulsory.

**Example (`hello.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Linux!"
```

Run it:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh   # give execute permission
./hello.sh
```

üëâ Output:

```
Hello, Linux!
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Variables

Variables = storage for data (name, number, path).

**Define variables:**

```bash
name="Riya"
age=19
```

‚ö†Ô∏è No spaces around `=`.

**Use variables:**

```bash
echo "My name is $name and I am $age years old."
```

üëâ Output:

```
My name is Riya and I am 19 years old.
```

**Some built-in variables:**

```bash
echo $HOME   # home directory
echo $USER   # current username
echo $PWD    # current folder
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ User Input

Ask user for input:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your favorite subject:"
read subject
echo "You chose $subject"
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ If-Else (Conditions)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
num=10

if [ $num -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "Number is greater than 5"
else
    echo "Number is less or equal to 5"
fi
```

Operators: `-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-ge`, `-le`

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Loops

**For Loop:**

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

**While Loop:**

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 3 ]
do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))
done
```

**Until Loop:**

```bash
x=1
until [ $x -gt 3 ]
do
    echo "Value: $x"
    ((x++))
done
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Functions

Reusable block of code.
